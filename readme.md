# Tracery 3 v0.1.0

## About

The original Tracery was developed by Kate Compton, beginning March 2013 as a class assignment and can be found [here](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery/tree/tracery2).

This version was initially forked from there, but as part of my development of [DashBot](https://github.com/aNickzz/DashBot) I ended up rewriting it completely. I recommend you read the original readme. This implementation have some extra features, but at the time of writing this, uses a fully backwards compatible syntax / definition json.
